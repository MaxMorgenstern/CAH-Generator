# CAH-Generator
A [CardsAgainstHumanity] Card Generator
=============

This tool was made to create custom Cards Against Humanity (CAH) cards in full size, as most other tools either generate small cards for printing or are limited to just a hand full of cards per generation cycle, this tool generates full size cards for professional printing on playcards.

This in HTML and PHP written app creates black or white cards from a provided text file.
It can be used as an online tool but also (as it was intended in the first place) used locally.



System requirements
----
In order to get this tool running you need a working webserver running PHP as well as a modern HTML5 compatible browser.
For card generation the font "Helvetica" is used. So you need to have this font instaled on your Computer, running the php-Script.



Options
----

While white cards are generated as provided, black cards will be distinguished betwen "Standard", "Pick 2", "Draw 2 Pick 3" and "Gear" (not an official type).

You can force the generator to use one of those typed by adding to a line of text:

[[2]] Pick 2
[[3]] Draw 2 Pick 3
[[G]] or [[g]] Gear
